### **🌟 What You’ll Learn:**

**🧠 Transformers Uncovered:**
- 🔍 **Foundational Concepts**: Explore the core ideas behind transformers, including attention mechanisms, tokenization, and various transformer types.
- 📜 **Paper & Theory**: Study the breakthrough "Attention is All You Need" paper and gain insights into how it revolutionized the field.
- 🔧 **Hands-On Implementation**: Code a transformer from scratch in PyTorch, with deep dives into each part, from positional encoding to different attention mechanisms.

**🛠️ Building the Model - Architectural Mastery:**
- 🎯 **Positional Encoding & Attention Mechanisms**: Understand each component of transformer architecture, experimenting with positional encodings and attention mechanisms.
- 🔍 **Pretraining Essentials**: Gather and process data, create PyTorch datasets, and gain hands-on experience building a miniature version of Llama3 for a solid grasp of pretraining.

**🚀 Advanced Fine-Tuning & Evaluation:**
- 💡 **Fine-Tuning Techniques**: Master fine-tuning approaches, such as LoRA, SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning), and Hugging Face workflows, to tailor models for specific tasks.
- 🧪 **Evaluation Metrics**: Measure model performance with tools like perplexity, and fine-tune for specialized applications with metrics that ensure high-quality results.
- 🔄 **Quantization & Optimization**: Streamline your model using techniques like quantization, pruning, and distillation for improved efficiency.

**💡 Real-World Applications & Deployment:**
- 🛠️ **RAG & Agent Building**: Build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model from scratch and design simple agents capable of handling real-world NLP tasks.
- 🌐 **Deploying Your Model**: Use frameworks like Ollama and LitServe to serve your model live, making it accessible to users via a web-ready NLP application.
- 🔄 **Model Merging & MOE**: Experiment with model merging techniques and Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures to enhance model capabilities.
